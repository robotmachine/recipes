# Cast Iron Cornbread

## Description

## Ingredients
* ~1 Tbsp Lard or Bacon Drippings
* 2 Cups Cornmeal
* 2 Tsp Baking Soda
* 1 Tsp Salt
* 1 Tbsp Sugar (Optional)
* 1 Medium Egg
* 1 1/4 Cups Buttermilk
* 6 Tbsp Butter, Melted
* 1/2 to 1 Cup Sweet Corn Kernels

## Method
1. Coat a 10" cast iron pan in grease (lard or bacon drippings) and put in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400ºF with the pan inside.  
2. Mix together all dry ingredients (cornmeal, salt, baking soda, and sugar)  
3. If using an egg, beat it into the buttermilk in a separate container and mix into the dry ingredients. If skipping the egg, just whisk the buttermilk into the dry ingredients  
4. Whisk in the melted butter until everything is well mixed  
5. Add in the corn kernels to the mixture  
5. Remove the pan from the oven and add the batter to the pan (ensure the batter is evenly distributed)  
6. Bake at 400ºF for about twenty minutes or until the edges are slightly browned and a toothpick comes out clean from the centre  
7. Let rest for another twenty minutes on a cooling rack or trivet  
8. Cut in to wedges and serve  

## Notes
* The sugar is entirely optional, but if you like sweet cornbread then by all means add it  
* The corn can be frozen or fresh, but should not be from a can unless strained and mostly dried or else it will cause the batter to be too thin
