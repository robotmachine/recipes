## Ingredients
* 3 Cups Masa Harina para Tamales
* 4 Cups Chicken Stock
* 8 oz Lard
* 2 Tsp Baking Powder
* 2 Tsp Kosher Salt
* 4 Cups Meat Filling (See Notes)
* 2 Tbsp Lime Juice
* 3 Doz. Corn Husks, Soaked in Water for 1 hour
* Salsa Verde to Serve

## Method
### Stage 1: Making the Dough
1. Combine masa and two cups of chicken stock and let stand for fifteen minutes  
2. Combine lard, kosher salt, and baking powder in a separate bowl  
3. Mix until well whipped, about one minute  
4. Add masa and stock mixture about 1/4 at a time until thoroughly mixed  
5. Add in another cup of chicken stock until the mixture is a soft and spreadable mixture  
6. Cover and refrigerate for about an hour
7. Prior to usage, mix again and add more chicken stock (one tablespoon at a time) until desired consistency returns  

### State 2: Assembling Tamales
1. Lay a corn husk flat and add the dough mixture in the middle, about 1/4 inch thick leaving about an inch on all sides  
2. Place a large tablespoon of filling (see notes) in the middle of the dough  
3. Fold the sides and then bottom of the husk so the dough surrounds the filling  
4. Tie a strip of corn husk around the middle to secure  
5. Add about an inch of water to the bottom of a large pot and place a steamer basket in the bottom  
6. Place finished tamales with the open side up in the steamer basket  
7. Cover and steam for about an hour, until the dough is no longer sticking to the corn husks  
8. Serve immediately with salsa verde, or let cool and freeze (see notes)

## Notes
The meat filling can be any pulled meat (chicken, beef, pork) mixed with some salsa to add wetness
Frozen tamales can be steamed for about 10 minutes for a quick lunch
