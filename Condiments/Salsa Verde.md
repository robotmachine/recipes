# Salsa Verde

## Description
Everything is better with a little salsa  

## Ingredients
* 1.5 Lb. Tomatillos, Husks Removed and Halved
* Medium White Onion, Peeled and Halved
* Two to Four Peppers, Halved (See Note)
* 1/2 Cup Cilantro, Stems Removed
* 1 Tbsp Vegetable Oil
* Salt

## Method
1. Prepare an oven rack to be four to five inches from the top broiler and pre-heat broiler  
2. Cover a baking pan with foil and place tomatillos, onion, and peppers cut-side-down  
3. Broil until well blackened and the tomatillos are completely tender, about five to eight minutes  
4. Transfer blackened vegetables, including any juices, and about half of the cilantro to a blender  
5. Blend until roughly pureed, do not liquify  
6. Add oil into a medium sauce pan until shimmering  
7. Add in mixture from blender, caution: it will likely spit  
8. Stir constantly until the mixture is thickened enough to coat the spoon, about three minutes  
9. Remove from heat and stir in the rest of the cilantro, roughly chopped
10. Season to taste with salt and let cool  

## Notes
Jalapeno or Habanero peppers can be used for a spicy salsa; poblano, anaheim, or serrano can be used for medium or mild salsa. Removing ribs and seeds will reduce spiciness.
